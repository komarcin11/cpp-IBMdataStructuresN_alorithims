// first_cpp_code.cpp
#include <iostream> // this is calling std lib
using namespace std; // noooo ide what this code does but without this u need to iner std:: before cout

int main() {
    cout << "Hello world\n"; //cout means C output that is the code to output the values, after every statement u need to add ;
    std:: cout<<"hello world\n"; // the std:: is needed if u dong include "using namespace std;" before the main function
}
